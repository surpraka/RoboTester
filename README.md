# Utility : RoboTester

##Introduction : 
RoboTester is a sapient proprietary tool, which helps to automate web pages directly from manual test cases
using the concept of Machine Learing(ML) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) via Python. It has the
capability to use existing Java Frameworks, along with the support of crossbrowser testing. It extends
the support to execute testcases over jenkins also.

##Usage : 
Roboster wants user to prepare some test data before execution i.e.,
	
	1. Write Manual TestCases :
		> Open excel named as 'TestCases' in the project repo.
		> Each sheet in excel workbook is considered as one manual testcase.
		> Each sheet has three columns other than 'Driver Sheet' - 'Scenario' , 'Steps' , 'Actions'.
		> Write manual testcases in natural language under 'Actions' Column.
		> While writing testcase under Actions column, It is important to put the entity under single quotes
		  i.e., User open the URl 'WWW.google.com'.
	2. Get Ready with Regression Suite :
		> Open an excel workbook named 'TestCases', it has first sheet named as 'Driver'.
		> 'Driver' sheet has three columns - Scenario, EndToEndExecutionFlag[Y/N], RegressionExecutionFlag[Y/N].
		> 'Scenario' column represents the number of testcases with thier names.
		> 'EndToEndExecutionFlag[Y/N]' column is a flag to execute the specific number of scenarios as End to End workflow.
		> 'RegressionExecutionFlag[Y/N]' column is a flag to execute the each scenario as an independent workflow over the browser.
	3. Choose Proper Browser Type :
		> Open 'DriverConfig' folder in project repository.
		> Then, Open 'BrowserType' file and mention the Flag as 'Y/N' in the front of browser key.

Finally, run the 'execute' bat(in the project repository) file to initiate the Robotester.
